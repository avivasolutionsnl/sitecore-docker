Run Sitecore 9 (with XConnect) using Docker and Windows containers.

# Disclaimer
This repository contains experimental code that we use in development setups. We do not consider the current code in this repository ready for production.
Hopefully this will help you to get up and running with Sitecore and Docker. By no means we consider ourselves Docker experts and thus expect these images to still contain a lot of bugs. Great help for creating this setup was provided by the [sitecoreops](https://github.com/sitecoreops/sitecore-images) and [sitecore-nine-docker](https://github.com/pbering/sitecore-nine-docker) repos. Please feel free to provide feedback by creating an issue, PR, etc. 

# Requirements
- Windows 10 update 1709 (with Hyper-V enabled)
- Docker for Windows (version 1712 or better): https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/
- Visual Studio 15.5.3
- Sitecore installation files

# Build
As Sitecore does not distribute Docker images, the first step is to build the required Docker images.
For this you need the Sitecore installation files and a Sitecore license file. What files to use are set by environment variables (interpreted by docker-compose); download all the packages that are defined by variables in the `.env` file and place them in the `files` directory.

The xp0 Sitecore topology requires SSL between the services, for this we need self signed certificates for the 
xConnect and SOLR roles. You can generate these by running the `./Generate-Certificates.ps1` script (note that this requires an Administrator elevated powershell environment and you may need to set the correct execution policy, e.g. `PS> powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`).

Next, modify the `.env` file and change the build parameters if needed:

| Field                     | Description                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SQL_SA_PASSWORD           | The password to use for the SQL sa user          |
| SQL_DB_PREFIX             | Prefix to use for all DB names                   |
| SOLR_HOST_NAME            | Host name to use for the SOLR instance           |
| SOLR_PORT                 | Port to use for the SOLR instance                |
| SOLR_SERVICE_NAME         | Name of the SOLR Windows service                 |
| XCONNECT_SITE_NAME        | Host name of the Xconnect site                   |
| XCONNECT_SOLR_CORE_PREFIX | Prefix to use for the XConnect SOLR cores        |
| SITECORE_SITE_NAME        | Host name of the Sitecore site                   |
| SITECORE_SOLR_CORE_PREFIX | Prefix to use for the Sitecore SOLR cores        |

Now perform the Docker build step:
```
PS> docker-compose build
``` 

The build results in the following Docker images:
- sitecore: IIS + ASP.NET + Sitecore
- mssql: MS SQL + Sitecore databases
- solr: Apache Solr 
- xconnect: IIS + ASP.NET + XConnect

As final step build all Solr indexes (populate and re-build indexes) from Sitecore (reachable at https://sitecore/sitecore), and perform a Docker commit for the Solr image to persist the changes (otherwise you will have to redo this step each time).

# Run
Docker compose is used to start up all required services.

Place the Sitecore source files in the `.\wwwroot\sitecore` directory.

Create the log directories which are mounted in the Docker compose file:
```
PS> ./CreateLogDirs.ps1
```

Create a webroot directory:
```
PS> mkdir -p wwwroot/sitecore
```

To start Sitecore:
```
PS> docker-compose up
```

## DNS
The containers have fixed IP addresses in the docker compose file. The easiest way to access the containers from the host is by adding the following to your hosts file:

``` Hosts
172.16.1.2	mssql
172.16.1.3	sitecore
172.16.1.4	solr
172.16.1.5	xconnect
```

## Log files
Logging is set up to log on the host under the logs folder of this repository. 

# Known issues
Docker for Windows can be unstable at times, some troubleshooting tips are listed below.

## Containers not reachable by domain name
Sometimes the internal Docker DNS is malfunctioning and containers (e.g. mssql) cannot be reached by domain name. To solve this restart the Docker daemon.

## Clean up network hosting
In case it's no longer possible to create networks and docker network commands don't work give this a try: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/live/windows-server-container-tools/CleanupContainerHostNetworking

## Clean Docker install
In case nothing else helps, perform a clean Docker install using the following steps:
- Uninstall Docker

- Check that no Windows Containers are running (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hostcomputeservice/get-computeprocess?view=win10-ps):
```
PS> Get-ComputeProcess
```
and if so, stop them using `Stop-ComputeProcess`.

- Remove the `C:\ProgramData\Docker` directory (and Windows Containers) using the [docker-ci-zap](https://github.com/jhowardmsft/docker-ci-zap) tool as administrator in `cmd`:
```
PS> docker-ci-zap.exe -folder "c:\ProgramData\Docker"
```

- Install Docker

## Docker build fails
Docker for Windows build can be flaky from time to time. Error messages like below can be solved by trying harder (i.e. more often) and making sure no other programs (e.g. file explorer) have the applicable directory open. 
```
ERROR: Service 'solr' failed to build: failed to register layer: re-exec error: exit status 1: output: remove \\?\C:\ProgramData\Docker\windowsfilter\6d12d77235757f9e1cdd58216d104f0e51bc56e6021cf206a2dd6d97b0d3520f\UtilityVM\Files\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-a..ence-inventory-core_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.16299.15_none_81bfff856a844456\aepic.dll: Access is denied.
